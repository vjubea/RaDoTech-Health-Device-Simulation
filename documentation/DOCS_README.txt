General Documentation:
Documentation.pdf contains all the major documentation - use cases, UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, and the requirements traceability matrix. This documentation folder additionally contains raw and compiled versions of some features of that document in case they are of insufficient resolution or are better accessible in those forms. Those are detailed below.

Sequence Diagrams: 
sequence diagrams are stored in the general documentation pdf, but they may be too low resolution to be readable. If this is the case, raw versions of all sequence diagrams can be found in the rawSequenceDiagrams folder, and can be compiled on https://sequencediagram.org/ for better resolution.

UML Diagram:
Similarly, the UML diagram is also saved as a PNG here in case the resolution is too poor on the PDF. PDF is preferred since it has comments.
