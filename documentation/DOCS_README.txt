Sequence Diagrams: 
sequence diagrams are stored in the general documentation pdf, but they may be too low resolution to be readable. If this is the case, raw versions of all sequence diagrams can be found in the rawSequenceDiagrams folder, and can be compiled on https://sequencediagram.org/ for better resolution.

UML Diagram:
Similarly, the UML diagram is also saved as a PNG here in case the resolution is too poor on the PDF. PDF is preferred since it has comments.
