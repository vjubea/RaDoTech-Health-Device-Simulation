            full Profile page and subpages from it in mainwindow, and much of the work integrating other pages of mainwindow with the model.

# Codebase & Executables:
/src contains all .cpp and .h files. It can be built using the VM's QTcreator or run like any other program. 
Files include:
defs.h
mainwindow.[h/cpp/ui]
model.[h/cpp]
profile.[h/cpp]
scanner.[h/cpp]
snapshot.[h/cpp]
dbmanager.[h/cpp]

# Use Cases, Textual Explanation of Design Decisions, Requirements Traceability Matrix
/documentation has all documentation. See DOCS_README.txt for more info

# Video Demo
NOTE DONE YET!!
